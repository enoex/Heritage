Entity Component System
---
To keep in mind:
    -Uses events for communication between Entities and Entity
        -when entity updates a component, event is triggered

-Questions:
    -Should coupled components have dependencies?
        -e.g., Physics requires entity to have a Position component.
            when adding a physics component, should it error or require a
            position component to exist already (or add one automaticaly?)
        -How to manage component <-> component dependencies?


TODO
=========================================
Place world wrapping functionality in world component instead of physics?
