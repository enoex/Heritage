#============================================================================
#
#Systems - All
#   Loads all the systems and returns an object containing all system names
#   and systems
#
#
#INTERFACE:
#   When called, pass in an entities object (normally, this is ALL entities)
#       returns an object of key:value pairs of systemName: systemObject
#
#System Class Interface
#   -Each system class must take in entities as an argument in its constructor
#   -Each system must provide a tick() method if it wishes to be called inside
#       the game loop, and can may accept a delta argument
